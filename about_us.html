            <p>From a Missed flight to a successful journey, this is how our founder journey, Hiren Sodha, started.</p><br>
    
            <p>In May 2015, while traveling with his family from Ahmedabad to Mumbai airport, the local car rental vendor's vehicle encountered issues that resulted in a six-hour delay. Despite their best efforts, the vendor could not arrange an alternative vehicle, causing the family to miss their flight and their entire travel plan to go awry. This incident sparked an idea in the founder's mind, leading to the birth of AssureCab.</p><br>
